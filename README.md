# CMPE-272-Project-Evento-Fall18
Contains idea of our team project "Evento" (Fall 18 semester), its report and featureEngineering.py that I authored for the project's machine-learning part taken up by me and another fellow student. It also contains a file “machineLearningInEvento.txt” describing the steps involved in training the model - right from data pre-processing to actual training and accessing through an API.
